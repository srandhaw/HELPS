(From left) The electronics inside the capsule. They include the sensors and a Mica-2 wireless node. At the bottom (top right photograph) has two holes to allow air to enter. The capsule has a cap (bottom left photograph) that blocks rain from entering. The cap does not seal the top; instead, air can flow under the cap. The air channel from the bottom to the cap. (bottom right photograph) The capsule was deployed outside our lab for two weeks in July 2008. Two thunderstorms occurred during these two weeks and the sensors continuously measured the CO2 level and the temperature. The antenna is protected inside the capsule in this deployment.</h4>

Moreover, each node has it own clock. The main challenge is developing a set of beamforming algorithms that can tolerate the uncertainty of nodes’ locations, frequencies, and phase differences. The photographs show the experiments to validate our preliminary results of beamforming algorithms. The experiments were conducted outdoors to reduce the interference of reflective waves.
